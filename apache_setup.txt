------
setup apache ssl
------

follow the steps for creating ssl crt & key (from the akami page, linked to on the app page)

# BUT at the last step put the .crt & .key files in 
  /etc/httpd/vhosts.d/certs/scc.crt
  /etc/httpd/vhosts.d/certs/scc.key
# note that i had to create these folders

------
setup apache wsgi module
------

sudo yum install mod_wsgi
# this is an apache module that you were missing

# for some reason i had duplicate files
#   /etc/httpd/conf.d/scc.conf
#   /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssc.conf
# so i moved scc.conf to scc.conf.disabled

cp /opt/pythonenv/v2_ordergroove-py27/v2/scc/apache/django.wsgi.bak /opt/pythonenv/v2_ordergroove-py27/v2/scc/apache/django.wsgi
# this file is listed in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssc.conf

=> these django endpoints can be accessed from host browser

------
use the new "scc-env" wsgi
------

edited /etc/httpd/conf.d/scc.conf to point to new "/opt/pythonenv/scc-env" folder
created "scc-env/scc/scc/apache/django.wsgi"
ran server from there

=> does not seem to be working
